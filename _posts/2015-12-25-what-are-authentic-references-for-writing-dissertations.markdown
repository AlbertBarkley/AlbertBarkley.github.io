The authentic references are described as authentic sources that you have searched for your work. It is essential to a great extend that you must understand that authentic references does not mean to use references that are there in your references but the references section also requires the in text citation that you use for your dissertation. The best use of in text citations can be made by [dissertation writing services](https://www.cheap-essay-writing.co.uk/cheap-dissertation-writing-services-uk/). All these sources should be authentic therefore your work holds some worth. While talking about in text citation in this article we should the major issue related to premature writer. Most of the students put the page number as per desire to get rid of the situation for the moment but this can become a severe offense. This is more than you can imagine and it can have worse results.

The students in their pre mature writing stage tend to do some tactics that they feel can help them out but in reality it just wastes there time. First they waste their time in thinking of such tactics then when they are able to think of such tactics they take more time in thinking If this would be possible for not. Then they finally get the courage to apply it on their thesis and the moment they do it, it is all in vain. The supervisors and the externals pick it up the moment they see it and they ultimately ask you to remove or correct this offense from your thesis. So act wisely. Here are further details for the topic;

## Bibliography:
Bibliography is also one section of your references. Although it doesnâ€™t come under the reference section but these are also ultimately the sources that you have sources that you have used in your thesis. One major problem that lies with this section is that students are not able to understand the differences between bibliography, references and in text citation in their work. The bibliography can also have sources of the references section but it does not possess the in text citation but only the sources of those intext citations. And in the reference section, specially the sources of the in text citation is pointed out.

## In Text Citation:
The [in text citations](https://library.leeds.ac.uk/homepage/91/harvard_citations) are the works that you quote in your main body thesis. It is the information used in your literature review and the quotes in your introduction section. The in text citation has the quotes of the paper therefore this part is not pointed out in the bibliography. The in text citation is also not easy to cater because you need to keep in mind the standard formats you are using for thesis. For each formatting the idea of in text citation is different. Therefore read first and then edit your work. 

In short to summarize, it is essential that you must understand that the authentic sources are important and you ought to know about it. The students majorly are not aware of the idea and when they are done with the thesis, they are informed by the supervisors to put in citations.
